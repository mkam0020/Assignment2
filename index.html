        <h1>Meteorite Landing location and Year</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="row1">
        <div class="column3"><p>Many meteorites land on earth every year with most being small and landing in unpopulated areas. 
            This visulaisation will look at where these meteorites land and when they were found. Most meteorites land in the ocean and cannot be recovered.
            The data on this page is from between 1750 and 2013, with meteorites larger than 0.1kg.
        </p></div>
        <div class="column3"><p>As seen in the map below most meteorites are found near populated areas as these are easier to find and have a greater chance to be seen falling from the sky.
            Where as areas like the North Pole, Greenland, the Amazon Rainforest and, Antartica don't have as much as there are less people and they are large areas.
        </p></div>
        <div class="column3"><p>Most meteorites have been found in the past 50 years as seen in the line graph below. This is due to people being more interested in meteorites and have a greater understanding of what is a meteorite is.
            This is also due to organisations like NASA(founded in 1959) who records the findings of meteorites.
        </p></div>

    <div style="width: 97%;height: 1050px;padding-left: 15px;" id="Main"></div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column4 left" id="LogHistogram"></div>
        <div class="column4 middleleft">
            <p>Most meterites are smaller with 6799 meteorites smaller than 1kg as seen in chart to the left. These meteorites are still dangerous as a meteor that is 0.5 kg can go through a roof or a car windshield.
                <br><br>
                With only 13 meteorites being larger than 10 tons. These meteors can do a lot of damage. In 2013 a 10 ton meteor broke up in the atmosphere above russia and caused 1,491 injuries and 33 million dollars of damages. And it didn't even hit earth.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column4 middleright" id="PieChart"></div>
        <div class="column4 right"><p>Meteorites are grouped into many different classes, with the more common classes shown in the pie chart to the left.
            The most common group of meteorites is the ordinary chondrites, this is then broken up into H, L and, LL chondrites.
            <br><br>
            The L indiactes a low amount of iron, H indicates a high amount of iron, and LL indicates low iron and low metal. With the Numbers being a further grouping.
            <br><br>
            The amount of H and L meteors is about even with The LL being significantly less. This is due to The low metal means the iron has undergone oxidation to form Iron Oxide (FeO), as there is not much oxgen is space LL is not common
